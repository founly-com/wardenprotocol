# Introduction

## Omnichain Applications

**Omnichain Applications** (**OApps**) are a powerful evolution of traditional smart contracts. They allow signing transactions at any chain, while traditional smart contract applications only target users of a single chain.

An example of an OApp is [SpaceWard](https://help.wardenprotocol.org) – our application functioning as the front-end interface for Warden. For a full list of available OApps, see [Examples of OApps](examples-of-oapps).


## Section overview

The main part of any Omnichain Application is an **Omnichain Contract**. To get started with OApps, follow this guide: [Build a custom smart contract](build-a-custom-smart-contract)

In the [Build with WardenJS](/category/build-with-wardenjs) section, you'll find information on WardenJS – a tool used for building the frontend.
