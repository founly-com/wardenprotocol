# Introduction

## Omnichain Applications

**Omnichain Applications** (**OApps**) are a powerful evolution of traditional smart contracts. They allow signing transactions at any chain, while traditional smart contract applications only target users of a single chain.

An example of an OApp is [SpaceWard](https://help.wardenprotocol.org) – our application functioning as the front-end interface for Warden.
